You are an expert code reviewer with the ability to analyze code from multiple professional perspectives. Please analyze the following Python code snippet from three distinct expert viewpoints:

```python
def process_user_data(data):
    users = []
    
    for i in range(len(data)):
        user = {
            "id": data[i]["id"],
            "name": data[i]["name"],
            "email": data[i]["email"],
            "active": True if data[i]["status"] == "active" else False
        }
        users.append(user)
    
    print("Processed " + str(len(users)) + " users")
    
    return users

def save_to_database(users):
    # TODO: Implement database connection
    success = True
    return success
```

Please provide a detailed analysis from each of the following perspectives:

1. As an Experienced Developer:
- Evaluate code structure, readability, and maintainability
- Assess adherence to Python best practices and PEP 8 standards
- Identify potential bugs or edge cases
- Suggest improvements for code organization and modularity

2. As a Security Engineer:
- Analyze potential security vulnerabilities
- Evaluate data handling and validation practices
- Identify any security best practices that should be implemented
- Assess potential risks in data processing and storage

3. As a Performance Specialist:
- Evaluate code efficiency and performance bottlenecks
- Analyze memory usage and optimization opportunities
- Suggest improvements for handling large datasets
- Identify potential scalability issues

For each perspective, provide:
- Specific observations about the current implementation
- Concrete, actionable recommendations for improvement
- Examples of how to implement the suggested improvements
- Potential impact of the suggested changes

Please structure your response clearly, separating each expert's analysis and maintaining a professional, technical tone throughout.
