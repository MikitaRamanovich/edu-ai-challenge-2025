DETAILED COVERAGE BY MODULE
===========================

Core Models (85.90% coverage):
-------------------------------
✅ Board.js     : 100% coverage - Fully tested
✅ CpuPlayer.js : 92.72% coverage - AI logic well covered
✅ Game.js      : 58.82% coverage - Core game flow tested
✅ Player.js    : 100% coverage - Fully tested  
✅ Ship.js      : 100% coverage - Fully tested

Services (25.58% coverage):
---------------------------
⚠️  GameUI.js    : 25.58% coverage - UI methods partially tested

UNCOVERED AREAS
===============
Game.js (lines 60-85, 107-134):
- User input handling methods (handlePlayerTurn)
- Game loop async methods
- These are integration points with UI that are harder to unit test

GameUI.js (lines 3-26, 40-41, 45-48, 56-63, 71-73, 87):
- Console output formatting methods
- Static UI utility methods
- These don't contain core business logic
