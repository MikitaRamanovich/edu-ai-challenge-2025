Step-by-Step Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Application Context**:
   - This is a social platform with millions of users.
   - It needs to store structured data: user profiles, user posts, and user relationships (connections).

2. **Data Types Involved**:
   - User profiles: typically structured and fit well into a relational or document-based model.
   - Posts: may include text, media links, timestamps—semi-structured data that scales with user activity.
   - Connections: these represent graph-like relationships (e.g., followers, friends).

3. **Performance Requirement**:
   - High read speed is critical, with 80% read and 20% write operations.
   - Therefore, read-optimized databases or architectures like replication and caching will help, but the underlying database should also support fast read queries efficiently.

4. **Scalability Requirement**:
   - The system must scale horizontally due to millions of users.
   - Therefore, distributed databases or those with native sharding and replication are preferred.

5. **Database Type Evaluation**:
   - **Relational (SQL)**: Good for structured data and ACID transactions, but can struggle with large-scale horizontal scaling and complex graph queries (e.g., mutual friends).
   - **Document (NoSQL, e.g., MongoDB)**: Flexible schema, good for profiles and posts, horizontally scalable, fast reads with proper indexing. However, not ideal for traversing user relationships.
   - **Graph Database (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)**: Excellent for modeling and querying user connections, like suggesting friends, exploring networks. Less efficient for bulk storage of profiles and posts.
   - **Hybrid approach**: Using a document store for profiles/posts + graph DB for user relationships could provide both performance and modeling flexibility.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Use **MongoDB (Document DB)** for user profiles and posts.
   - Use **Neo4j or Amazon Neptune (Graph DB)** for managing user connections.
   - This hybrid approach addresses all the requirements:
     - Fast reads via indexing in MongoDB.
     - Efficient relationship queries via graph DB.
     - Scalability via horizontal sharding in MongoDB and clustering in graph DBs.
     - Supports both structured and relationship-rich data models.

✅ Final Recommendation:
Use a **polyglot persistence architecture**:
→ MongoDB for storing user profiles and posts.  
→ Graph database like **Neo4j** for managing user connections.  
→ Ensure proper indexing and caching to support high read throughput.

This setup aligns with all project requirements: scalability, performance, appropriate data modeling, and operational distribution.
