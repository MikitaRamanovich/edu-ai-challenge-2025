You are a knowledgeable software architect helping design a backend system for a new application. Apply **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning** to analyze the following requirements and recommend the most appropriate type of database. Justify your decision step-by-step.

Requirements:
- The app is a social platform with millions of users.
- It needs to store user profiles, user posts, and the connections between users (like friends or followers).
- The database must support high read speeds.
- The expected workload is 80% read operations and 20% write operations.
- Scalability is important as the user base is expected to grow continuously.

Your task:
→ Break down the requirements one-by-one.
→ Discuss trade-offs between database types (relational, NoSQL, graph, etc.) based on these requirements.
→ Select the most suitable database or combination of databases.
→ Justify your recommendation clearly using logical steps.

Respond in a structured, clear, and concise format.
